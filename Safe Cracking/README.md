# Safe Cracking Lab Design
## _Used at our SAINTCON Vault Competition_

We created these units to expand the Sparrow's original safe housing to store things like our RFID Scoring Reader. This is the guide for how we build these. Included is:

- The STL Files Needed
- Parts List
- ✨Assesmbly  Magic ✨

## STL Files
There are three #D printed items we use. We print them in PLA.
- "Sparrows Safe Hole Mounting Plate Hole Guide.stl"
-- This file is used outside of the can to mark the placement of the carriage bolts as well as the whole for the dial shaft.
- "Sparrows Safe Hole Mounting Plate.stl"
-- This is what is mounted to the lid on the inside which holds the safe body.
- "Latch Catch.stl"
-- This is a buffer material to extend the thickness inside the lid to allow the latch to catch.
